              The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of
              stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally
              built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern
              borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against
              the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the
              Eurasian Steppe.

            <p>
              Christ the Redeemer, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount
              Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro. Its origins date to just after World
              War I, when some Brazilians feared a “tide of godlessness.” They
              proposed a statue, which was ultimately designed by Heitor da
              Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski. Construction began
              in 1926 and was completed five years later.

            <p>
              This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the
              world’s most iconic monuments and is perhaps the finest example of
              Mughal architecture. It was built by Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned
              1628–58) to honor his wife Mumtāz Maḥal (“Chosen One of the
              Palace”), who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child. It
              took about 22 years and 20,000 workers to construct the complex,
              which includes an immense garden with a reflecting pool.
